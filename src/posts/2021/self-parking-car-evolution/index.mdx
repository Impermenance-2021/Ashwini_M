## TL;DR

In this article we'll train the car to do self-parking using a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

We'll create **the first generation** of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

**On the ‚âà40th generation** the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot (although hitting the other cars along the way):

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

You may launch the üöï [Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator](https://trekhleb.dev/self-parking-car-evolution) to see the evolution process directly in you browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

- You may [train the cars from scratch](https://trekhleb.dev/self-parking-car-evolution?parking=evolution#/) and adjust genetic parameters by yourself
- You may [see the trained (almost) self-parking cars in action](https://trekhleb.dev/self-parking-car-evolution?parking=automatic#/)
- You may also [try to park the car manualy](https://trekhleb.dev/self-parking-car-evolution?parking=manual#/).

‚ÑπÔ∏è We're going to use a genetic algorithm to evolve cars genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...
